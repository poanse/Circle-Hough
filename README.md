# Circle-Hough
My script for spherical particle size measurement on SEM images. Circles are found using Circle Hough Transform.
"Hough.py" outputs a .txt file with diameters, a .png with a histogram and a cropped copy of the original image with drawn circles for quality control.
"Hough_merge.py" combines multiple .txt files into a .txt file and a histogram.
